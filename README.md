## Overview

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

- Live Site: [REST Countries of the World](https://rest-countries-mocha.vercel.app/)

## Project Development

### Running the App

- Clone the repo by running the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/princemuel/rest-countries.git
```

- Enter into the project folder:

```bash
cd rest-countries
```

- Install the project's dependencies:

```bash
# NOTE: This project uses pnpm as package manager but that's optional. You may delete the lockfile and install the deps using your choice of package manager

npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

- Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Deploying the App

Your app is ready to be deployed! The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://react.dev/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - For composing component styles using utility classes

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰');
};
```
